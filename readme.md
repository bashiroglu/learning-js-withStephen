This is the repo of my notes about JS. I took these notes while I code along and watch the course called [Modern Javascript Bootcamp Course (2020)](https://www.udemy.com/course/javascript-beginners-complete-tutorial/) by Colt and Stephen Grider.

Notes in this repo will be mainly about Stephen's explination about and my understanding of those projects.
