# Testing in JS

We write code and the test to see whether we get expected output or not, for that we use if blocks or assert module(check node js documentation).

#### The test files in front-end

The test files in back-end and front-end are different, in backend we have access to assert codes but in front we don't, we can still write if blocks to check but it not the way how developers are doing it. For this purpose we use chai. But to test code in browser we use mocha.
